# ✊📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors

## 🎯 About
This program allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The computer makes a choice between the same three options using the `rand` function to ensure randomness.
- The game determines the outcome:
  - The user **wins**.
  - The user **loses**.
  - The game ends in a **draw**.

🎮 Have fun and test your luck against the computer! 😊
